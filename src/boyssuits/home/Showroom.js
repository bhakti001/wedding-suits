            tailoring and custom made suits for discerning customers looking for
            something unique. Hand cut and finished to your exact measurements,
            every element is made to your specification, from leg taper to
            sleeve length, jacket lining to custom buttons, monogramming and
            embroidery. The result is a one-of-a-kind suit as individual as you.
