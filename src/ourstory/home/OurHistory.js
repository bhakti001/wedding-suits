          <p className="our-third">
            Our family business can be traced back to a tailor’s shop in
            Wolverhampton’s Snow Hill in 1931. In 1990, we decided to transform
            the formal suit hire experience by creating a brand built on a
            longstanding reputation for quality.

          <p className="our-third mt-2">
            
            We began crafting exceptional men’s suits for weddings with high
            standards woven into every detail, from the craftsmanship of the
            garments to the personalised appointments. We have since gone on to
            become the UK’s leading wedding suit supplier. With our own local
            showrooms as well as supplying over 250 independent UK retailers.
